        <h1>Reflecting on Foundations</h1>
        <p>
            I have learned several things about my ego over the course of my learning through Foundations and the first week of Bootcamp. I've noticed that I will fluctuate between feeling extremely clever and competent, and the suddenly being confronted with a day where I have no idea what I'm doing and the imposter syndrome sets in. I have also had the uncomfortable realisation that I have always managed to 'make do' with my learning, by either fudging what I'm talking about or just winging it and somehow making it all work. I don't think that will last me very long on this course, in part due to the technical nature of the work and simply because the course is not designed in such a way that I'll make it through by jumping in blindly.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to learning and programming, values are what will keep me trying and working to solve and overcome obstacles. Valuing things like integrity and accountability and applying those values will mean that I contribute to group projects and will further my own learning in order to be able to keep contributing. Empathy and self-awareness are how I will see what I am struggling with, what my obstacles are, and be able to share that with others who might be experiencing something similar.

            Its been surprising to find that I still have a long way to go when it comes to understanding myself. I have turned my life around mainly because of the level of self awareness and honesty I have had to display internally and externally, but even going to those lengths is nowhere near the end of what it means to know who I am.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that the approach of this school is one that focuses on more than just making me someone who can code. Its about helping someone become a good programmer in every aspect of that role. With any role, lack of self awareness, integrity, definable values or ability will have a big impact on whether that person is able to do that role well or at all. It impacts other people around them, and perhaps impacts the company or project they are a part of. It will certainly impact the relationships they have within the community. By addressing all these aspects this school aims to navigate around and through those potential problems, and set me up to be both a decent human capable of fulfilling a role well and able to continue my learning and development after I leave the academy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think learning the core aspects of Foundations were helpful, and at the very least gave me a good understanding of what the overall goal of Devacademy is. Without understanding what it is we are aiming to do here it is difficult to commit to doing it, and Core was a good way to establish the goals early on.
