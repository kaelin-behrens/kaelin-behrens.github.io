    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <p>Long term I want to achieve a lifestyle that grants me a high degree of choice and adaptability. I want to be able to a bit of everything, and to be able to do it from anywhere.
    <p>When it comes to learning I know that I do extremely well if given a problem to solve on my own. Especially if it involves finding or creating a new set of systems as part of the
      solution. My limitations are to do with my perceived interest in something, if I lack interest or find the topic simple or stale I will put up blockers and struggle to get
      through the content. This was very true when it came to the longer videos we have had to watch, I find that I will go look up diagrams and articles instead. Passively learning
      through wrote means is not my forte.</p>
    <p>Skills that I want to see refined at my time here would be my ability to work on a project and build something with teammates. 
      This is something I have little to no experience in.</p>
    <p>Making sure things get done is something I have had to learn as I live with untreated ADHD. Time blindness is something I deal with a lot, as well as the feelings of being
      overwhelmed by workload. Using a calendar and timers to ensure things get done has been effective, and I'll continue to use these options. I also know that communicating clearly
      with everyone on what I need and what I'm struggling with will be a good way to make sure that everyone is in the loop, and help with managing tasks and time. I will keep on top of
      my physical wellbeing through gym and running as it helps me manage my emotional and mental faculties. Most of all I will continue to practice honesty with myself and those
      around me.</p>
    <p>As I commit to honesty from my end, I hope for that same commitment from others. I want the team at Dev Academy to be honest with me, and I'm sure they will be.</p>
