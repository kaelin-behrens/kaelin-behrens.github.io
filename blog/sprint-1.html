    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>
One of the biggest complications of answering this question comes from the fact that I have such a strong divide between who I was and who I am. 
I am now roughly four years clean and sober. 
I am an addict, I always will be an addict, but I could not tell you if I’ve always been an addict. 
I spent ten years of my life struggling against self-sabotage of truly astounding proportions. 
I spent the last four years rediscovering, learning, relearning, and rebuilding my life and myself. 
While this all sounds very serious and carries a lot of emotional weight to it I am happy to say that things are going very well, I am quite content, 
and I have experienced some incredible growth because of my life’s events. 
Getting clean and sober was both an ethical and a practical decision. It took a decade but at some point I 
had enough bad things pile-up that I suddenly realized that the only common factor in all of it was me, and my actions. 
I cannot describe in any meaningful way just how many things clicked in that realization, but I can say that two very important things occurred to me. 
Firstly, if I continued to live the way I was living I would die a lot sooner than I was comfortable with.  
Secondly, very few of my decisions and actions had been made in a vacuum. The things I had done had consequences, and not just for me. I know I scared my mother half to death. 
I know I had hurt others and had greatly damaged others’ trust in me with my behavior. 
The list goes on. If I wanted to stop hurting other people and survive till I was ready to move on from this life, I had no choice but to go into recovery. 
So I made that choice. And now I am here. 
There is no question in me of whether I did the right thing. The weighing up of this ethical dilemma is not something I lose sleep over, 
but questions about who I am in comparison to who I was do keep me awake. 
Addiction is a tough thing to understand. Some part of it could be seen as illness, or a condition. Some part of it is also choice. 
Where that line is drawn is something I will probably spend my life contemplating. 
That is an ethical and existential dilemma that I know I must keep examining, and I feel deep within myself that I will probably never have a clear answer. That isn’t the point. 
The important thing is to keep investigating it within myself, learning from it what I can, and seeing what others have to say about it. 

There are several other guiding points from the prompt I was given for this first post, and I think that the things I have to say will be a lot less emotionally heavy from here on out.

Culturally I know I have a lot of perspectives and mannerisms that come from the USA, as my biological father is Californian, and I spent some of my early years in Seattle. 
I have a strange blend of US and Kiwi cultural views and norms that ultimately make me feel quite independent of both cultures. 
I do see that the US influence tends to give me the freedom to complain about something I don’t like or feel comfortable asking for a refund or replacement for something I don’t think 
measures up to its price. These are not culturally common behaviors for Kiwi’s. 
I think the more Kiwi aspect of “don’t rock the boat” or “she’ll be right” is frustrating, but at the same time there is a different sense of respect within it. 
Ultimately I hope I strike a balance between the forthright and self-determined aspects of US culture, and the ability to be respectful of the common peace that comes from Kiwi culture. 
As for my strengths, I asked my parents and closest friend for a summary of how they see me. I trust them to be honest with me, and I think they were. 
The common thread of what they had to say were variations of integrity, honesty, justice, and honor. My parents both mentioned that I have very high capability, 
with a lack of application or follow-through. I can safely say that I agree with all these points, and they are things I would have mentioned on my own. 
This means that I am totally capable of learning everything DevAcademy can teach, and I can be honest enough to say that I may struggle to do it.
I also know that one of my biggest gaps in experience is working on a project with others. I have worked as part of a team in a hospitality role, and as a manager, 
and I can speak to these things. I have little to no experience working with others to build something. 
This will be a learning experience for me, one that I can see my inexperience and preference for individual work to be an obstacle to doing well, if I am not honest with myself and aware.
