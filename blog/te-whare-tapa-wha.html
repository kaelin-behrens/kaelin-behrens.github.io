    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Wha</h1>
    <h2>Taha Tinana</h2>
    <p>My physical wellbeing will be based on actively practising better sleep regiments through the use of alarms, timers, calender reminders as well as consistently going to the gym at least three times a week, for a minimum of forty minutes.</p>
    <h2>Taha Whanau</h2>
    <p>The closest family I have are people like my partner, who I will be going through this course with, and my friends, who I regularly engage with in online spaces. Outside of this I will try to maintain contact with my immediate family via video calls every few weeks, as I currently do. If I can find the means and the time I will endeavour to engage with my whanau in person more regularly.</p>
    <h2>Taha Hinengaro</h2>
    <p>Yoga before bed most nights, the rituals I have around the gym, getting out of my room or workspace regularly and seeing the sky and the greenery, these will all contribute to this passively. I will start to engage with the meditative practises I used to use as well, starting this week (29/01/2024).</p>
    <h2>Taha Wairua</h2>
    <p>This will fall into the same sets of habits and activities I have already mentioned, as I have no faith to express. Trying to actively be appreciative for specific things in my life each day might be something more exclusive to my spiritual wellbeing.</p>
    <h2>Whenua</h2>
    <p>Climbing Mt. Eden whenever I feel the need to, exploring the city on my scooter when I have that itch to get out. Finding new parks and quiet spaces to enjoy when I can.</p>
