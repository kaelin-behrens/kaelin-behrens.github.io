    <h1>Solving and Explaining Problems</h1>
    <p>
      Finding a specific problem I have had with my code or my understanding during this course is not something I can do easily. Funnily enough, the problem with this kind of question is that there are a lot of problems to choose from. So many that I cannot really recall anything so specific. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I do know that I had a textbook scenario early on with setting up my blog, and I jumped on a Discord call to chat with a friend to find a solution. He had recently started working in the field and would be able to help. I started explaining to him exactly what it was I was trying to do, and before I could even tell him the issue I was having the solution came to me. We both had a good laugh at the fact that we had just played out the Rubber Ducky scenario to a T.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general the frustration I feel when I don't understand a problem is pretty normal, though I know when I am tired or hungry that frustration can get the better of me. I often find myself feeling annoyed at the prospect of a simple solution to my problem, that feeling that I could easily figure it out and if I ask for help or finally solve it the simplicity will make me feel silly or stupid. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing to learn from this is a lesson I still need to reiterate to myself - simple solutions do not make me stupid or silly. They are solutions, and if they come from asking for help then that is simply what needed to be asked. Its ok to be gentle with myself if I don't understand something. Also - I need to get myself a rubber ducky.

    <h1>Problem-solving Techniques</h1>
    <p>
      Pseudocode: I find this extremely helpful as the course goes on, its easy to get lost in what I am trying to build, or what I want a function to do. Writing this out in plain english helps refocus my effort and my understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trying something: I recently tried to do the Bowling Kata in a  way that ultimately made little sense. It involved building my mathmetical solution to the scoring into the same function used to check a ruleset. Ultimately it proved to be a lengthy and impractical solution, but would have made for really cool code. I like the experimentation.

      Rubber Ducky method: Please see story above.
    </p>
  <p>
    Error Messages: Sometimes these can be more confusing than helpful, but more often than not this is something that can be understood by googling the error message, otherwise these are easy enough to use to troubleshoot. Typescript is rapidly becoming something I really appreciate.
